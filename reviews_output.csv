https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/0cefdd44-20be-4fe0-9fdf-30cae3479c61,"My periods were very heavy and painful right from the start at age 13.  I was put on the pill by my GP aged 17 but not investigated.  This made things manageable regarding bleeding and flooding, although I had all of the other symptoms described and my periods were always 7-10 days long.
Aged 30, the pill just stopped controlling everything and I was bleeding all of the time.  I tried different pills, mirena coil (helped for about 18 months, then a replacement coil had to be removed after 6 weeks due to intense pain), until eventually I stopped everything.  I was in a job where I could manage my own diary and would schedule/re-schedule appointments accordingly but was always told by the medical profession to just 'live with it'.  Eventually, aged 48, I had a hysterectomy and was diagnosed with endometriosis and adenomyosis.  To say I felt let down and angry is an understatement - I finally started my life aged 48."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/fed1f9cc-72de-4d1d-bb99-32e09b635873,"I've had severe back en stomach pain continuously throughout my life, since the age of 14. Periods started only because I got on the pill at age 17. Periods were extremely painful, felt terribly ill everytime for at least 10 days. Got irritable bowl syndrome, intermittent fever syndrome, extreme back pain. The pain kept me up at night for 8 years. Had to stop working. 

Had surgery 6 months ago: it's a piece of cake compared to the suffering before. The backpain was instantly gone. Had a mass on my uterus and the endometriosis in my uterine bands flipped my uterus, a very painful condition. Endometriose caused adhesions in my lower pelvis. Releasing these adhesions had  major impact on bowl symptoms and abdominal and lower back pain."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/859fe79e-ed6d-45a2-b1d7-b45e45b0b95d,"After around 4 years of being on naproxen (after trying over the counter pain relief) and being diagnosed with “dysmenorrhea/bad period pains” I asked my GP to refer me a gynaecologist! Alongside the severe pains I was experiencing on and around my period, I also experienced vomiting and fainting episodes. I had previously been diagnosed with IBS but have noticed this seems to be at its worst when I am ovulating.

After being referred to a gynaecologist and having a laparoscopy, stage 1/2 endo was found. Since surgery I had around 6 months of lessened symptoms and then the pain has gradually increased again over time. However, I have noticed my GP now take my symptoms a lot more seriously following my diagnosis and are more keen to keep on top of my chronic pain."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/66957976-d9ed-4e0c-a9cc-2dc7e0a3419a,"I had ovulation and period pain since I started periods at 14, accompanied by vomiting and diarrhoea, but initially it only started the day before my period and only lasted the first 2-3 days. My symptoms gradually got worse, with the pain starting earlier and earlier, then I started getting severe IBS type symptoms. I later developed pain after sex. In the year before diagnosis, I started getting fevers and severe nausea usually during my period, but sometimes a week or so before or after. Eventually I developed a groin swelling along with the fever, my GP insisted I go to A&E but I was told I'd wait all night so I went home and next day had a private MRI and then laparoscopic diagnosis. In Northern Ireland the waiting lists are very long for endometriosis diagnosis, so I self funded private appointments and surgery. I am currently using the combined pill to stop my cycles to hopefully keep the endometriosis lesions from growing and to control my symptoms. I also avoid alcohol and foods high in saturated fat as ingesting those always flares my pain. I eat a plant based diet as dairy causes constipation which also makes my pain worse, and the additional fibre in a plant based diet also helps with the bowel symptoms."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/163ca055-c2a5-4ee5-8750-223472b30922,"Ovarian cyst at 21 lead to diagnosis of stage 4 endo. Birth control pill managed my symptoms for years, however, needed hysterectomy this year aged 36 for CIN3 recurring cells. Since surgery and off of birth control have experienced a high level of daily endo related pain."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/876e0001-d406-443f-a880-329db459eb18,"I was diagnosed during Covid, I was referred to a private hospital via the NHS. It was the first time I was really listened to and felt validated. 
My symptoms became severe in my early 20s and I was diagnosed at 32. 
Endometriosis is not cyclical, it’s every day. I had a coil which stopped by periods but I had pelvic pain every day. I bled every time I had inercourse and I have IBS symptoms. 
I’ve had to have a hysterectomy to stop the constant pain and slow down growth."

https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/f641b273-b218-42eb-be69-65752e518119,"My periods were regular from the age of 10-16; every three weeks nearly to the day.. When I was 16/17 they became irregular and extremely heavy and painful. I was changing my pad every 1-2 hours and passing large clots. This made me anxious to leave the house on heavy days.  Everyone in my family who has periods have all had problems so I thought it was normal and I didn't know better. Doctors said it was probably stress and put me on the pill. I remained on the pill with no questions until I was 24 which is when I began to suspect something was wrong. 

My pain became worse which included: pelvic pain most of the month, severe bloating, fatigue, nausea, migraines, pain in my back and legs, and pain going to the toilet, especially bowel problems. I fought to have a laparoscopy in April 2019 and was told there was nothing wrong with me when I woke up after the surgery. The gynaecologist who performed the procedure suggested it was a bowel issue and probably IBS. After this, no doctors listened to me even though I was researching every condition I could think of that might be related. I think I saw nearly every GP in the practice, yet not one would refer me back to gynaecology. In 2022, I was fortunate that I was able to see a private gynaecologist who listened to me and agreed that my symptoms were ""textbook"" endometriosis. She performed a laparoscopy with excision and formally diagnosed me. 

It was such a relief to be diagnosed because I knew that I wasn't inventing my symptoms and now I have something concrete to work with. After my my second surgery, I was able to manage most days with minimal pain. I began to make plans again and started to reclaim a social life and hobbies.

However, earlier on this year my pain levels started to increase. I've recently left my retail job as it was too much to stand all day and am currently seeking a remote or hybrid role to manage my health better. People don't like to hear about others' chronic health problems so I don't talk about it much. However, most of my friends and family are supportive. On a good day I barely notice my symptoms, however on a bad day I start thinking of ways in which I can persuade my GP to refer me back to gynae. I didn't plan on having another surgery so soon, so I'm hoping it won't become an issue just yet."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/5e22947c-7163-4537-bc35-1ec21d250d88,"I lived with extremely painful and heavy periods right from my first one at age 12. The other girls in my class would be sore but I would be in agony, bent double and sobbing in the toilets when a period came. I was basically told I was being dramatic and that every girl has periods, so to just ‘get on with it’. I was on contraception at 13 to try and control the pain. 

I had significant bladder pain and infections starting when I was late teens and had multiple, invasive and painful procedures on my bladder over a number of years as it was thought I may have painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis. I was hospitalised twice in my early 20s with burst ovarian cysts and was told ‘it’s only a 5cm cyst so it shouldn’t be painful. I don’t know what the issue is’. The hospital then forgot to send any information to my GP and when they took blood again at my surgery, I had them calling within 24 hours to put me immediately onto antibiotics as my inflammation markers were sky high. 

I came off contraception when I was 30 to try for a baby. I was bent double in agony at this stage and really struggling to function at all. The pain was constant and not just around my period. I was advised the waiting time for gynaecology was months and I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I paid for a consultation. The consultant was 60-70% sure it was endometriosis. I’d never heard that before and this wasn’t mentioned in any diagnoses previously. I then paid for a surgery as the waiting time was 2 years on the NHS and they found stage 3 endometriosis over my entire pelvic region. 

I had excision surgery a year after this diagnosis and then a year following that a total hysterectomy as the pain wouldn’t go. Thankfully I did manage to conceive prior to that decision, but I will never be able to give that child a sibling as a result. 

Endometriosis ruins lives and it’s not taken seriously enough. The treatments for it are contraception or nothing and now I’m in the menopause, it’s been extremely difficult to access information about this too. Women’s health deserves more attention and I hope that by raising awareness about the signs and symptoms of this debilitating condition, others may get checked out quicker and push for some early support. Living in constant pain is exhausting and it’s easy to feel alone, but no one with this condition is alone. We’re all here with each other, getting by as best we can."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/aae0fe2c-091a-46b7-be4d-e6bd26e4441f,"I was diagnosed with a MRI scan followed by a laproscopy and have just had my 2nd laproscopy. My periods started aged 11 and they were extremely heavy. The pain was so bad to the point where I could barely walk. It was incredibly lonely as i was young and others around me led normal lives with their periods. Over the years, I learnt to manage enough to attend school/college/uni but it got to a point where I wouldn't stop bleeding for months on end. We trialled many pills and the injection over the years and settled on Nore with Micro with no gaps at all. These stopped my period but the pain and burning sensation was still around. After my first surgery I finally had a life but this was short lived and my symptoms started getting worse again. For a whole month I couldn't walk. My bowels weren't tolerating anything. The pain was only getting worse and I barely had a quality of life. I've now had my surgery with a Endo specialist and am hopeful about my recovery."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/215a480f-bfb5-492e-a0a3-4af3581a5f62,"I was first diagnosed when I was 21 - I had been having heavy and painful periods since I first got them at 11 years old and was put on contraception to help but it didn't. I was constantly invalidated by doctors who told me period pain was normal. One doctor prescribed me with a high dose of ibuprofen for the pain. This ended up causing me to develop stomach ulcers as I was so nauseous from the pain I had been taking them on an empty stomach. At the hospital they did a laproscopy and I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis. At 22 and at 27 I had surgery to burn off my lesions but it always comes back after 6 or so months pain free. 

Aged 29 I started to develop severe IBS symptoms. The doctors ignored me when I said it might be related to my endometriosis and sent me down multiple paths including blaming anxiety, diet and my weight. I'm currently being investigated for endo lesions on my bowels after 3 years of being mucked around. 

My quality of life has been completely ruined, I barely leave the house these days because when I'm not in pain the week before and during my period I'm experiencing issues with IBS-D. I used to be outgoing, loved to party, meeting people, travelling but I feel like I'm a shell of who I used to be. Doctors think the only way to help me is a full hysterectomy, but I'm not sure I want an entire organ removed, it is a tough decision. 

I have had issues with many people disregarding my condition, even people who care about me have suggested I'm overreacting. A therapist told me it would be my fault if my partner cheated on me because despite being in pain I still must apparently meet his ""needs"" in the bedroom. Living with endometriosis has been painful but manageable for the most part until recently, but I find the hardest thing is other people's opinions, and how the pain affects my relationship. Hopefully something can be done eventually to prevent other women from living like so many of us do."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/7003036b-8ece-4a72-b257-f805c4cd9cdf,"Periods started at 14, remember being on holiday on the beach, and just suddenly flooding my swimming costume and not knowing what to do. Had pelvic pain for months before, but it was brushed off. 

Saw over 30 different GPs in 14 years while trying to get diagnosed. Pain journals ignored or rubbished, requests for ultrasounds and referrals to gynae rejected. Just went through every hormonal contraceptive available, various painkillers. Ended up in A&E several times a year.

Blood tests have shown severe anaemia for 15 years but been told it was normal. 

Last year, junior doctor doing GP rotation sent me for an urgent ultrasound. He was worried. Ultrasound showed one endometrioma. NHS gynaecologist refused to treat me. She belittled me during the appointment, telling me it's painless and that it's impossible for me to fill the largest size mooncups in 4 minutes. Went private, and they did an MRI for pelvic mapping. Four endometriomas on right ovary, varying sizes. Right ovary and right side of uterus stuck to abdominal muscle wall. Indications of endometriosis lesions on bladder and bowel. Left ovary appeared clear on the MRI, in normal position, but some adhesions may form in future. 

Now discharged back to GP because private gynae can't do anything else to help.

Was genuinely quicker to get Dignitas approval than an endo diagnosis. That took nine months. Endo was almost fifteen years. 

Lost jobs over endo. Have no friends and no life because I'm unwell from it all the time. 16 days out of 30 I'm bedbound. I hate it."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/493546cb-bbab-4f7c-adc6-915519a5ad7d,"My periods were pretty painful from about the age of 14, normal painkillers didn't make a difference but I assumed I was just sensitive to pain. I flooded on several occasions at school, embarrassing when we had pale summer dresses, so I ended up changing my clothes choices. In my early twenties I finally found a doctor who was willing to investigate. She sent me for an ultrasound which showed nothing so I believed it was not endometriosis. I got married and found sex incredibly painful which did impact our relationship. When I was in my early 30s, we wanted to have children, and found I could not conceive. We were referred on for infertility, and the gynaecologist said it was almost certainly endometriosis, and the ultrasound would never have shown it. When she performed a laparoscopy to check and treat, it was clear I had medium to severe endometriosis. I conceived my first child almost immediately. When they were about 9 months old, the pain came back, but after child number 2, I was given a Mirena coil which stopped my periods and the pain. No more writhing on the floor fantasising about stabbing my stomach to stop the pain! No more hitting myself to distract fro  it. I was not a wimp, I was suffering extreme pain - having gone through childbirth with minimal pain relief the endometriosis was up with that."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/931359d3-69c4-4334-bfea-e7f9b7b5db03,"I have struggled with horribly painful periods since I was around 13-14 which have worsened over time. I’ve been to the doctor so many times over the years, tried so many painkillers and contraceptive pills which gave me bad side effects, and was still struggling with my symptoms. 

My periods were getting longer and recently had been lasting from 10-14 days which was worrying me as the pain was also getting more unbearable. An ultrasound showed I had a polyp in my uterus so I decided to undergo surgery to remove this and asked the doctor whether this was causing my pain - she told me it was more likely a condition such as endometriosis, and that she could combine the surgery to remove the polyp with a laparoscopy to determine  whether my symptoms were related to endo. 

Finally, nearly 15 years after my symptoms first began, I was diagnosed with endometriosis which thankfully was removed, along with many polyps from my uterus. I’m a couple of weeks post surgery at the moment and hoping to see a big improvement in my quality of life; if you’re worried about your period symptoms and pain, please don’t doubt yourself and keep pressing for answers."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/9116b2c6-1513-4f7d-bc51-0e5f75de0168,"I was recently diagnosed with complex endometriosis affecting multiple organs and I’m currently awaiting laparoscopic excision surgery. I’m at a high risk of losing one or both ovaries as well as at risk of needing a colostomy, which can be difficult to cope with. I’m lucky that I have such a fantastic multidisciplinary team behind me who is taking all my needs into consideration. I’m also going through the process of exploring egg freezing before my surgery which is exciting!

Living with endometriosis can be lonely, but it’s the online community that makes it that little bit easier."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/fce5a27d-b15d-47a7-b5d4-d6983e752981,"I was diagnosed with PMS, then PMDD after my mental health around my periods was unmanageable, also blended with periods that were so heavy I was unable to use lots of typical collection methods and pain that prevented me from being able to move or function. I dread my period each month, only getting about a week of peace which is followed by a week of pain and low moods, the period itself which can be up to 11 days (around this) which I am constantly bleeding on, then a week of organising myself back together. I took the pill but this led me to get ""New Daily Persistent Headaches (NDPD)"" - migraines which meant I had to stop the pill due to risk of stroke, so despite the pill helping my mood (not always the pain) I am unable to find a way to sort this out"
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/3f552e87-91d7-4639-bcbd-3ba705c9aa26,"I was diagnosed in 2019 after a lengthy battle to have my laparoscopy. They removed all the endo they could find and I finally felt free of depression and pain. And at first I was so happy to finally know what was wrong with me, I had closure. But now I am drowning in anxiety knowing I have endometriosis and it currently cannot be cured. I am in agonising pain again every month around my period which I know is only going to get worse as it progresses again. I feel like a burden to my fiancé and son as when I am in pain I am debilitated. I feel emotional and frustrated that this is happening to me. I am glad I know what’s wrong with, but I just wish there was more being done to find out why it’s happening and how to cure it, instead of covering up our symptoms"
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/fed6ec83-f78c-46d5-bb28-9699bbfb1264,"My periods have been awful since they started around 14, around 15 I was slapped on the pill (microgynen) there was no investigation as WHY. Afterwards I fainted picking them up at the chemist. 

Cut a year later where I was put on anti depressants (fluoxitine) due to anxiety, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. There was no check ups on me or my meds until I was about 23 they informed me my meds have increase chance of breast cancer (my mum had stage 3c breast cancer) 

first I decided to come off my anti depressants mostly due to emotional numbing (I could not be happy on them only numb or depressed) this was a horrific time, I struggled with withdrawal massively. When I realised that I still had all the same mental health issues (even after a lovely therapist) painful heavily periods, going from a size 6 to a size 14 (I only could poop once a week) acne covering my face, debilitating anxiety, I decided to ask my GP for help (I have NEVER had a good gp) they told me to try Yazmin.

This is where I had what I would say mentally the worst time in my life. I developed some kind of psychosis, I was terrified of everyone/everything/everywhere. I felt like something was going to hurt me all the time, I thought my parents would die. I couldn't leave my house, if I did I would have panic attacks, I couldn't figure out what was real, I couldn't read/watch any of my favourite fantasy books/games because I thought I'd get confused what was real. I had a horrible sense of dread 24/7 and my life was constant panic attacks multiple times a day. I did not stay on this long and decided f*ck all this! No more birth control! And came off everything.

This was 2019,every gp I spoke to told me ""the pill doesn't do any of that"" 

A weird time adjusting, slowly the dread and anxiety was clearing up, my periods didn't come back for a while and when they did they were manageable for a bit. 

Most of all, I learnt for the first time who me was! And wow! I cried so much from happiness, turns out I was a confident, happy, bubbly artistic woman. And she was wonderful! I just fell in love with her over this time, it was around covid and I had the time to finally find me for the first time in my life, turns out she loves wearing colour and not black baggy clothing, she paints her room bright blue and loves the sun. 

I couldn't believe my mental health, and I decided to go solo backpacking to Morocco and then Australia after covid where I had the best year of my life. Something previous me wouldn't have even crossed her mind. But then, the pain trickled back in slowly over time. My periods were weird and I just accepted it. I came back home to the UK after a year and they were getting worse over time, my mood was dampening and I found by October 2023 I was lugging through life, no one around me understood. And the stress and the isolation was mentally spiralling for me.

In October I had 3 periods in a month, it wouldn't stop it was almost like when I had my bad period at 15 where I ended up bleeding for 4 months straight. I asked for an ultrasound with my GP who begrudgingly agreed finally, she seemed bored of me being there and continously told me it's a one off and I'm fine. I pushed. Thank god.

Over this time I'm getting so much worse, the fatigue is everyday. I'm spotting. I dropped my usual yoga daily, my hikes my walks, connecting with nature, everything I loved. For now the pain is only on my periods, and every period is like a rusty knife gouging me open and burning up my insides, running all down my legs. Oh god the restless thighs could've sent me mad. I still got these pains on the pill but rarely. Now it was every period. I would cry on the floor of my kitchen begging why me? how is this normal? Why does no one care? And I'd have to go to work normally like everyone else.

After the ultrasound, it took over a month to get my results back after constantly calling them and getting different excuses. Eventually the RECEPTIONIST told me ""looks all fine but you could call a follow up appointment if you want""

THANK GOD I did.

I had a cervical cyst, it wasn't explaining my periods but it was explaining the constant spotting I had. So anyway they refered me to a gynocologist for treatment

6 month wait for a consultant.

I was getting worse, now I had pain off my period, ovulation was horrible. Slowly over time I had pain peeing (a GP pushed for STI test and nothing else I tried to explain it's INSIDE and a pulling pain) constipation, painful sex, a bloating that never ceased. I started to not like looking in the mirror.

I wouldn't say I'm religious but maybe I was sent an angel. My grandmother passed in this time, we had a beautiful funeral but I have a feeling this was her doing! Turns out she knew a gynocologist who I met. And she was wonderful and she saved me.

But she was a 2 hour drive away and a different hospital. I tried to get my GP to move me but they would just copy and paste the same email telling me to wait until my 6 month appointment. My beautiful boyfriend found out about the Right To Choose service in the UK, if your appointment is a long time you can choose your own different clinic. So I replied to my useless GP ""I would like to discuss my right to choose options with this, and if not I would like you to put your rejection onto my records"" 

I woke up that next morning with a booked appointment. 

Within weeks, phone call consultations, blood tests and an an MRI was done. We had discussed possible PCOS and PMDD.

But the MRI showed something much more severe. It turns out I have Stage 4 endometriosis and Adenomyosis that has spread via a large nodule all over my bowel. Before even a lap surgery.

Unfortunately it's outside of my lovely doctors area so I am being referred again.

Above all I want people to know do not put up with your horrible GPs there ARE good doctors out there. This disease feels so isolating, you watch everyone live normal lives while you try to just survive every day. It's unfair, we need a cure. 

My next steps are a refferal to another specialist and lap surgery."
https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/84587b33-f029-4f5f-8172-16a95dd10878,"I started my periods at age 10 which were heavy, painful & crippling. By age 12 I was put on the contraceptive pill without any investigation or concern why I was in so much pain. Over my teen years I continued to struggle with my periods, menstrual health, bowel & mental health. Missing so much school then having to leave half way through year 11 due to severe depression & sat my GCSEs from home. At 17 my symptoms were getting increasingly worse from painful, constant periods which lasted weeks on end, erratic & painful bowel movements & stomach issues, pain during/after sex, bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, pelvic pain, lower back pain, fatigue & insomnia. So I went to my doctors to spend the next 5-6 years being dismissed, fobbed off & gaslighted with being told I just had IBS, gluten intolerances, stress, part of being a woman & normal to have all these issues. I eventually had a GP listen to me after so many trips to the doctors & A&E to the point I countless jobs due to being so unwell. She referred me to my endometriosis specialist & in 2016 at 23 I was diagnosed on my first laparoscopy with endometriosis found on my left ovary & bowel. Since, I have also been diagnosed with adenomyosis, fibromylagia & had to have another four surgeries where endometriosis has been found, grown back & spread to not only my left ovary & bowel but also my bladder & womb. Endometriosis has fused my organs together resulting in my almost losing my left ovary, bowel & fallopian tubes leaving me with permanent organ damage. Not only is the condition itself aggressive & progressive, but the domino effect it creates with issues such as adhesions. On my last surgery in February this year, I had extensive adhesions from under my left rib all the way down to my pelvis. With each surgery the time frame between them has got slimmer & the relief is becoming non existent. My last 2 surgeries I have had to have privately due to the spread & regrowth of the condition, being proactive & having to pre-empt knowing my body means I have nearly missed losing organs or even further irreversible damage then if I had waited the long wait times for surgery. Living with the conditions has impacted all aspects from life, from my mobility, my fertility, my career, my mental & more. My dream of becoming a Mum is something that may not happen now due to fertility issues but also being so unwell that I don’t feel it is realistic to be able to fulfil that goal. I had to give up my job last year & heavily rely on my husband as my carer. I have tried everything to manage & live as best as I can with these conditions from chemical menopause, pain medications, treatments, procedures, holistic therapies & more."

I have been fobbed off time and time again until last year I was finally listened to and referred to the gynaecologist. They suggested endometriosis but because of my BMI wouldn't refer me for a laparoscopy, instead gave me the mini pill. Was told I could come back within 6 months if it doesn't help my symptoms. 
After about 4 months and constant bleeding from the mini pill I decided to go back, only to be told I was misinformed and I only had a 3 month window to come back. 
I now have to be referred again and have been told it is now a 2 year waiting list.

I've suffered with painful, heavy, long periods since I started at age 12 (I'm now 29!) I've managed the pain with ibuprofen and paracetamol (which has taken a toll on my stomach and bowels over the years) and GPs and nurses have only advised changes in contraception (like many other women, I've tried so many types now). On average, my periods last 10 days (but can be up to 16) and I experience pain and bleeding between periods every month. This costs a lot of money in period products, my anxiety levels are sky high, it's affecting my relationship because sex is so painful, and it's massively damaging my mental health.

They kept telling me I had IBS but I kept pushing for further tests. 4 years later I got a laparoscopy and I had it around my deep pockets in wrapped around my bowl, my pelvis, lower spine, and on my womb. 
Living with the symptoms before I got the coil were awful. Constant diarrhoea and stomach cramps which gave me no warning, life was taken away, I could barely leave the house, if I did there had to be a toilet close by. 
Then I got the marina coil which changed the symptoms just got a serve pulling pain. This was easier to live with, but no painkillers helped, I tried stronger pain killers like  codine & naproxen, it was pointless, didn’t do anything. The pain was so severe. Now I’ve finally had a laparoscopy and the symptoms have eased but still getting the pulling pain."

thankfully my doctors were amazing and I was referred and ended up having a laparoscopy where it was found i had severe endometriosis and it was also stuck on my bowel wall. whilst under I had the mirena coil fitted (more on that later)
slight complication after procedure in that my bladder stopped working so I had to have a catheter for a few days while it recovered so ended up staying rather than a day patient.
The mirena coil has been my life saver, i have continued to have them fitted and I have not had one period since and no pain. 
For me it is slightly painful to have fitted/taken out as my cervix is tilted and I havent found a practitioner yet that has managed it on first attempt, in saying this it hasnt put me off as the benefits outway this.
I am now using the coil as part of my HRT treatment"

This was in 2016. The care from the consultant was terrible, claimed it was only IBS, finally had a laparoscopy in 2017 and was diagnosed with endo but discharged with no follow up or after care.

Finally with an actual endo clinic where they care and are looking after me properly, have diagnosed fibroids which they found in 2017 but didn’t tell me about.

It was not an easy journey, it involved medical gaslighting, being told my pain was in my head, feeling guilt and shame even mentioning the pain I was in. The moment I was diagnosed I felt a sense of relief that I wasn’t crazy, and then I had the crushing sense of knowing that I had endometriosis. It’s a bitter sweet feeling, but at least I finally had answers. Getting a diagnosis was only possible as my parents were willing to pay for me to go privately due to the impact on my physical and mental health, I will forever be grateful to them for their help. I had to advocate for myself so many times, and asked specifically for excision after lots of reading. Whilst under I had a coil fitted too, in the hope that it would help with my symptoms. 
Since my surgery my quality of life drastically improved, I was able to go back to the gym and have a life again. Although slowly (1.5 years later) some of my more painful symptoms are starting to return. Although my coil does help, I still have a period every month so a lot of my symptoms continue to be cyclical. My luteal phase is hell, so much pain, I feel like the shell of the person I was. However I do have 1 good week a month which isn’t ideal but is better than nothing! I realise the burden I carry in day to day life, the consideration that has to go into going into the office, or going out for a meal - suddenly I’m packing pain meds, I’m thinking ahead to food options, I’m asking for decaf coffee and tea, I’m wearing bloat friendly clothing, maybe period knickers for just in case. However, ive learnt to be kind to myself, I’ve learnt to have empathy and understanding with my body which is a gift I’ve never given myself before. I’m super fortunate that my husband is the most amazing man and supports me through it all wholeheartedly, I know it’s hard on him, but he always has my back and is ready to pick up the slack when I’m struggling. It’s a constant struggle to not get weighed down by chronic illness, or overwhelmed by it all. No one understands unless they are going through it too, so it can feel a very lonely place."

I was on the contraceptive pill for about 15 years before I made the decision during the Covid lockdown to come off it (combined) - until then I had never experienced any cramps, heavy periods or suffered from acne. These started almost immediately after coming off the pill and they were extreme. Accompanied by severe anxiety, very irregular periods and dreadful mental health. Now a few years on my symptoms are still the following; heavy flow, painful cramps, severe lower back pain, digestive issues, acne, cramping, ovulation pain. During an average period, on my heaviest day I pass clots hourly and I soak through 3-4 pairs of “heavy flow” period pants. However, My periods last for 7 days and are now fairly regular. I have gone back to the GP 3 times in the last 18 months. About 12 months ago I finally had a doctor who would listen and I was referred to OBGYN - I had an internal womb scan and nothing showed. My gynaecologist put me back on a progesterone only pill whilst I focussed on planning my wedding but now I am back off this and trying to conceive - with no success in the last three months. My next steps are to go back to my gynaecologist who has said they would be happy to do a laparoscopy if I want this. Also want to mention that my mum had endo, was ignored for 25 years - went in for a minor back operation and her endo was so bad (stage 4) it had attached itself to her major organs and she had to have a hysterectomy.

I had an MRI to find out what was going on and that identified several locations of endometriosis and I was then offered surgery. After a wait of almost a year, I finally had my surgery at the end of November 2023, where they found deep endometriosis all over my bowel and rectom which was all excised. My symptoms are incontinence both bowel and bladder, however I’ve not yet got to the bottom of my bladder issues as the surgery didn’t reveal any endometriosis there.

I’m lucky that after my initial treatment started to wear off that I was able to go private and be prescribed dienogest which for me is a miracle drug.  There are side effects (weight, acne) but the pros outweigh the negatives for me.

I was referred for an ultra sound.

For years I have spoken to different GPs about my pain but they just suggested changing contraception or prescribing different pain killers. My mother is a GP and both of us thought I had endometriosis for years before receiving a proper diagnosis. Even with her guidance and advice it took me about 15 years to get diagnosed. I was referred to different gynaecologists over the years, poked and prodded with no empathy or explanation for my pain. It eventually took Dr Simon Vaughan Jones (not sure if I’m allowed to name them here but he truly was amazing!) at the London Independent Hospital (on the NHS, darling) to arrange an MRI scan, which confirmed that I had endo. 

I now take the progesterone only pill back to back, which has stopped my periods, so I am pain free. But this doesn’t work for everyone and it isn’t a solution. My main concern is whether it will affect my fertility and ability to have children, but I’ve been told I won’t know that until I actually start trying to have children. So fingers crossed…"

I'd never felt pain like it or seen so much blood. 90% of my visits to the doctors have been about period pain affecting my day to day life. Since I was 15, I was put on the pill for pain management and I honestly can't recall if it helped as I've been on it all my adult life until coming off age 29. I'd cry after most conversations with the GP (I know they don't have much time so not GP bashing!) as I'd be asked the same questions like ""are you using the pill for anything other than contraception?"" YES! And was told different things about taking the pill back to back - that it's fine to do so and I don't need a break, that I MUST have a break every 3 months, or that I should always have a 7 day break. Since read up on The Lowdown's blog and know I was safe taking the combined pill back to back. I've been to the GP in tears on Christmas eve after laying crying on the bathroom floor in pain and was offered Mefanmic acid which didn't work for me. I've only had one GP say it sounds like endometriosis and they'd treat it with the pill anyway, so back to square 1 for me! ""here, have another pill!"" I've since come off the pill and feel better in my moods and can't say my periods feel any worse. It was nice not to have a bleed each month but I still had cramping and felt so bloated. So I feel like I've exchanged low mood for period pain. I don't know which is worse. How do you know when period pain is more than ""just period pain""?"

My bleeding was so heavy that I used to have to set an alarm for every hour to get up through the night to change and clean up otherwise I would just soak through everything. The pain I experienced was so bad that I used to pass out and ended up in hospital many times. Doctors never investigated and kept saying its life as a woman and I need to get on with it, period pain is normal. I used to tell them it was like no pain I'd ever experienced but they constantly dismissed it. The pain during my period is still the worst pain I've ever felt. I could never go to the toilet without experiencing severe pain whether on my period or not, the toilet bowl used to be full of my blood, my periods were lasting 2 weeks as a minimum and the amount of blood I used to lose was scary. I'd get diarrhoea and vomiting as well. I was back and to with my GP. I'd been on different pills and every pain killer going but nothing touched it. I was on iron tablets for anaemia. My GP told me it was impossible that I was still in pain. I had tried every pain killer possible and nothing even took the edge off. I'd taken things for cycle control that just made me more ill. You name it, I'd tried everything and more. That should have been a red flag but they just continued to say it was impossible and I couldn't be in pain. I think they believed I was making it up. At the age of 19, I collapsed and was rushed to hospital. The pain was so bad I physically couldn't move. Once again, I was discharged with no investigation and told to follow up with my GP. I went to a different GP this time and she immediately said she suspected endometriosis. She was mortified at how I'd been treated the last 6 years and how no one had taken me seriously. I had ultrasound scans which showed nothing but I was also booked in for my laparoscopy straight away and of course, endometriosis was found between my womb and bladder. To anyone awaiting a laparoscooy, mine went great. I had minimal pain afterwards, it was more discomfort and I felt a bit off from the anaesthetic but it was all very minor. It was worth it as this is the only way to definitively diagnose endometriosis. This then started the experiment of finding a treatment that worked. After a few more years, I tried the injection. This has been the only thing that has helped me. I can't say I'm pain free but I don't have periods, just occasional spotting. The pain I do experience isn't often and is what I would imagine normal period pain to be like. I can go about my life finally. Its been 10 years since I was diagnosed and 16 years of living with endometriosis and it still seems it isn't taken seriously enough and too many women are dismissed as it being just ""periods"". The more awareness of endometriosis is out there, the better. Hopefully future women won't have to wait years for a diagnosis."

Fast forward to 2019 I started suffering with very painful ovulation on my right hand side but scans were all clear. 

In 2020 my periods starting becoming very short, heavy and painful with significant clotting. Again, scans were all normal.

I've been taking Zoely for a while with some success and my long-awaited referral is coming up this month. Strongly suspect that my issues are being caused by adhesions/scar tissue and a reoccurrence of the endo I had lasered off 12 years ago.

UPDATE Nov23: I had my consultation in October and was told that they 'don't remove endo or adhesions any more because it just grows back worse' and that I should try a different pill or the coil (even though he admitted the coil probably wouldn't help my pain).

Very emotional, tearful, angry, boiling hot, greasy hair, spots etc.. 
Went to the doctors a couple of times in my mid 20s because very 3 weeks I was in agony. Couldn't walk, stand up straight.
Male dr laughed at me when I said my periods are very painful - is there anything I could do?
He said you are female, it's normal, what do you want me to do??
So i still thought this was normal - even my friends used to laugh at me when I was in pain.
1 day, I was in my own at home. Needed to drive to an job interview. 
I was in so much pain, I could hardly speak. I couldnt stand after my shower. I wanted to call an ambulance - but I didn't. 
I had that voice in my head. Call an ambulance for period pain - you idiot. So I didnt.
I carried on as normal....struggling being me.
We decided we wanted to try for a baby. I was 28. 
4 years it took me to fall pregnant. 
When in labour the pain was the same as my 3 weekly period pains! That's when I was dilated 2 - 3 cm
I now know that is not normal!!
2 failed pregnancies after my son was born.
1 was an ectopic pregnancy. Another Endometriosis problem!
My son is autistic and very demanding. 
Once my periods started again I couldn't cope, physically and mentally. 
I went to a nurse which specializes in womens health.
Explained everything....she prescribed me the pill which was great for the first 9 months. No periods, no problems. 
Then they started coming back and mentally I could cope again. I was loosing it every month. My temper was awful, I couldnt control it (verbally, not physically)
She prescribed me a double dose of the pill and Sertraline, anti depressants. I had heard these can help as I suspected I had PMDD due to servere mood swings.

They were extremely heavy and painful to the point where I was always in the nurses office at school or taking days off. I was good that I would grow out of it when I was older. Several years of doctors appointment and I was just told to go on the pill and constantly being dismissed for my pain. I mentioned endo to plenty of my doctors and they said no you’re too young you’re fine. It wasn’t until around 2020 my mum got diagnosed with endo after a laparoscopy that they finally even considered the possibly that I could have it to. Fast forward to now. I just had my first laparoscopy at 20 years old, diagnosed with severe stage 4 endometriosis. I’m currently waiting for another surgery to remove said cells but as it has gone to my liver and diaphragm it’s going to be complicated and I’m trying not to think about it too much. I am in constant pain somewhere in my body. My pelvis area feels so heavy and temperamental. Just wish they listened to me sooner.

I then went on Microgynon from the age of 16 and continued to take a contraceptive until the age of 27. I decided to stop and it took me 1.5 years to get my periods back. I suffered badly with hormones, they were all over the place, horrific fatigue, depression, pain, bleeding every 2-weeks etc., that all stopped me from working. I eventually got to see a doctor and was referred for scans / ultrasounds but nothing appeared. I then saw a private gynaecologist (I'm very lucky and get private healthcare through work - a godsend in this situation!), but sadly he just suggested going back on the pill, I was so desperate for it all to stop at this point that I did. I was feeling depressed everyday and was determined to figure this out the natural way so started doing my own research. I've been taking A LOT of supplements, cycle syncing etc., which has helped me get back my regular periods, but am still suffering a lot with the pain when they come. I've since been referred to a private gynae (very lucky) who specialises in endo and he's offered me a laroscopy in November which I am SO grateful for. I really feel for everyone suffering, it's absolutely ABSURD that we have to go through this as women and the research / care out there is really poor. I hope we start to see some big change soon."

I would also get bad headaches.  I often suffered with anaemia. I could bleed heavily for two weeks straight, have a few days of nothing and bleed heavily again for two more weeks. My periods have always been irregular. After 6 years going to and from the GP and trying numerous things to control the bleeding and/or symptoms I was finally referred to gynae at 18. I had an internal scan to rule out any kind of gynae cancer. I then tried yet another version of POP which didn't improve things. Finally they fitted a hormonal coil and this has been the only thing which has managed my periods (pain and bleeding) and ovulation pain. I no longer require strong pain killers when I have a period and usually I only get a light bit of spotting every so often. Sometimes I get some ovulation pain but it's mild compared to what I had previously. I'm on my second hormonal coil now and I've used the coil for symptom treatment for 7 years. I'm glad this has worked for me as I really didn't want to have any surgical procedures. It has been life changing."

While I've had painful and heavy periods since puberty and always suspected I had endo, I never bothered to look into it because I figured it would be invasive tests and the conclusion likely just putting me on hormonal contraception, which I'm already on. I only had this U/S scan because my GP recommended it after I developed bladder symptoms in the last few years.

It took 2 years 3 months from referral to laparoscopy, not having actually met my gynaecologist until the day of my surgery. I felt that I was dismissed because I didn’t have a lot of the typical endo symptoms and even on the day of surgery my surgeon made a point of telling me that “you do know that in 50% of these we don’t find anything”. I felt that she was a lot more understanding after surgery when she had found endo in 3 sites (2 of which would have been causing my pelvic/hip pain). I had a hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, excision from 3 sites and mirena inserted during my surgery last week. We will have to wait and see how my physical symptoms progress, but I feel vindicated that what I was feeling and verbalising to professionals was real and that I do know my body and deserve to be listened to."

https://thelowdown.com/reviews/endo/3b104823-dfff-48d1-911e-22a0e18df0c5,"I was diagnosed in May 2022 after 3 and a half years. I was 18 when my symptoms first started and was continuously told I had either IBS, pelvic inflammatory disease or was lead to believe my pain and symptoms were normal. I first knew something wasn’t right after having an ultrasound and finding my left ovary was adhered to my uterus. Doctors, GPs and nurses assured me this was normal, at the young age of 18. I’d had severely painful, and heavy periods all my life up until that time, but again, was assured this was normal and had never thought to question this further. I got into a relationship and quickly realised that intimate time was painful and uncomfortable, which ultimately impacted my relationship. During the pandemic my symptoms worsened. I’d been on the pill for 6 years to manage my periods, but this, I found, was detrimental to not only my physical, but mental health also. Mood swings and fatigue were, and still are things that I struggle with to this day due to this. In March 2021 I’d experienced severe pain during one of my periods, my mum took me to the doctors, despite being almost 20 at this time, in the hopes that having her with me to “vouch” for the severity in my symptoms would encourage doctors to take me more seriously. From this, I was admitted to hospital for 2 nights and 3 days on the specialised gynaecology ward. However, I was not treated for my symptoms, or even examined at this time, I was given fluids and antibiotics through a drip to combat my high temperature and “flu like symptoms”, as they described it. At this time I decided I would stop taking the pill. This helped my symptoms slightly, however my periods were extremely heavy, and I was changing my sanitary products up to twice every hour. After my stay in the hospital, I was referred for an outpatients appointment, which resulted in me being admitted to hospital once more. I was happy at the time, despite my symptoms, as I felt as though I was finally being taken seriously. However, after being on a ward for 24 hours, and finally seeing a doctor, he ushered me home with Buscopan tablets, as he was sure that I was experiencing symptoms of IBS, not those of endometriosis. Shortly after this, I was referred for an outpatients appointment, where I finally was booked in for an MRI scan. This revealed no abnormalities or complications, which, again, made me feel as though I was going mad, and all my symptoms were psychological. Luckily, I was seen by an amazing consultant who took all of my symptoms into consideration, listened to everything I had to say, without patronising me, and was referred for laparoscopic surgery. On the 23rd May 2022, I was (finally) diagnosed with endometriosis. My surgery revealed that I had several areas of stage 4 endo, my right ovary was adhered to my uterus, my large bowel was adhered to my pelvic wall, and my fallopian tubes were twisted. I finally felt listened to and almost wanted to shove those surgery notes in every doctor’s face who’d told me for 3 years that my symptoms were normal. Fast forward 18 months later,  and I still struggle with my endo everyday. I have tried the coil, which was quite honestly, the worst decision I ever made, and I’m currently back on the pill whilst I explore other options."

He said it was just something women should deal with and laparoscopies were too expensive for the NHS to do unless absolutely necessary and he didn’t think I was worth it. I of course lodged a formal complaint with the practice. At this point I spoke to my father about my period pains for the first time and he was horrified. He kindly offered to pay for me to see a consultant privately. The consultant spoke to me over the phone and within 15 mins said “I’m 99% sure you have endometriosis and you should’ve had the surgery years ago”. A few months later, I had a very successful surgery to remove my lesions which were on my uterus, bowels, bladder, and an ovary. It was such a relief coming out of surgery not only to have had the endometrial matter removed but to have been proven right after all those years - I hadn’t been mad or making it up. My pain was real and legitimate and I’d been repeatedly let down by doctors. My periods improved vastly following the surgery and I’ve never looked back. A year and half later I gave birth to my first baby. I do worry about endo returning but would redo the surgery in a heartbeat if it did."

The last time I did that it took 12 months to get out of my system and on that day I was vomiting, diarrhea and excruciating pain. I was told (by my GP) that is just how my body reacts to PERIODS. Great right! 

When I started to get pain again, after coming off the pill this time, it was going to take over a month for me to get a telephone appointment with my GP. Luckily, I have private health care with my job, so I opted for that. It took me over 15 years to be taken seriously! They sent me for a scan straight away. It was confirmed that one of my ovaries is in the wrong place and the other is attached to my uterus. My uterus is also small and everything is over to one side. 

Now I have some decisions to make as to how I get this treated. I can have the key hole surgery which won't stop it coming back, but at least I will know what stage I have. And/Or I can go back on the pill or have the coil. I really don't want to opt for the latter because I've been on hormones for over half of my life and it is only since coming off them, I feel liberated as a woman!

I have been looking at easing the symptoms through diet, I am hoping that it will help... But it's a working progress.

For anyone reading this, my advice is to purchase a myoovi (other brands available-a TENS machine that you can wear with nobody knowing) and don't give up!

Through my experience of multiple GPs and consultant (some ok, some horrendous), both physios I’ve seen have been the only people who have really tried to ease my symptoms and explain them to me.
